// Provide contact information
// Provide your email address or customer service phone number, or even call buyers in advance when you're selling higher priced items, so that buyers can talk to you about an issue first.

// Be responsive
// Do your best to respond quickly and professionally to all reasonable buyer inquiries.

// Suggest dispute resolutions
// Suggest to your buyer in opening a dispute with the PayPal Resolution Centre instead of filing a chargeback with their credit or debit card company.

// Provide a clear return policy
// Ensure you publish your return and refund policies on your website, auction listings and correspondence with customers, in clear and simple terms.

// Give accurate descriptions
// Provide information such as pictures, measurements and other relevant details on the item you are selling.

// Issue refunds when possible
// Avoid additional costs from chargebacks. Always use the refund link in the PayPal Resolution Centre to issue a refund. Refunds issued outside of PayPal are not covered under our Seller Protection programme
